# Scripts
A collection of my scripts I use on my various linux distros

##fanspeed.sh
Used to set fanspeed on a Macbooks fans on linux, sometimes my Mac fans wont adjust properly and I will want them faster or slower.
Check the rpm ranges of your fans before using, mine are 3000-6500
Use:
Make it executible by doing
>chmod 755 fanspeed.sh
Then simply execute it with the desired fanspeed where N is the desired fanspeed
>./fanspeed.sh -s N
